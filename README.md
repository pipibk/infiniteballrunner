# infiniteballrunner

This game uses the infinite runner game design approach, which is a game that never ends. The objective is to last as long as possible, and the longer you last, the higher your score.

You can make changes to this game by using graphics of your choice and modifying the colors. Developing this game helps you learn more about Python, and the Pygame framework.
